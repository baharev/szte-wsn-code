- command line arg parsing
  _WIN32 : path to device is F:
  copy (null needed)
  rescue (outfile does not exist)
  compare (null? to check format)
  check_format 

- rescue option, dd like tool copying the full device

- checking tool: all zeros / comparing two files bitwise

- factor out duplication: BlockDevice, DeviceFormatter
                          format: make a NullDevice and invoke Copy
                                         URand?

- move stdout/stderr I/O to Console
